Hi Nick,

You are right that you were very understanding about April. You were accommodating about the rent situation, and you were really kind in showing concern for my health at the time. You were also a great roommate overall in SF. I always enjoyed our conversations, and you were really nice about helping me get situated to the neighborhood when I first moved to SF. 
I would really like to find a friendly resolution to this issue. I emailed you initially because your messages over the past month have said that you would transfer me the security deposit as soon as Aim had paid you in full. After hearing that Aim paid you a week ago and not hearing from you, I wanted to understand what the situation was. 

It sounds like the issue regarding repayment of the security deposit is now coming down to you not having enough cash on hand at the moment. If that is the case, I would be happy to work out a payment schedule that would make things easier for you. My suggestion is that you could transfer me $550 of the deposit by 8/7, and the remainder by 8/20. 

Would such a schedule be amenable to you?

Thanks,
Julie




Hi Nick,

I would like to try and find a friendly resolution to this issue, but I'm having difficulty addressing your concerns as they are changing a bit in each of your emails.

I agree that you were very understanding about April. Since you ultimately decided not to invoke your right to evict me and I have agreed to pay a late fee, however, I do not see why that is still relevant to discussions of the security deposit now. Furthermore, since you have now had almost month to search for a new roommate and have been paid rent by Aim for the last 30 days of our agreement (July), I do not see why you this affects you holding my security deposit.

With regards to the mattress, I would be happy to schedule and pay for a service to move the mattress at a time that is convenient for you. Although you offered to handle this when we last spoke in San Francisco, I understand that this may be an imposition for you and am willing to pay you $25 for the time required to let the pick-up service into the apartment.

Was I not pretty understanding about the entire situation? What landlord would let you pay rent 25 days late and not evict you? This is the real world, people have bills to pay and $1,350 is a lot for someone else to cover while they have their own share of rent and bills to pay.

Aim wants her security deposit back on Saturday, 4 days before her moveout which is never done typically. I am accommodating her since she has to fly back to Thailand. Because she paid both the rent and the deposit late and now needs the deposit back before moving out, I don't have the money to cover the remainder of August until the 15th. And I disagree as a suitable replacement doesn't constitute someone who moves in for one month.

You also stated that you'd be scheduling someone to come pick up the mattress once she leaves; that's going to ultimately fall on me having to be home to let them in or sell it if the new roommate doesn't want to use it. If I have to take the time and money to handle that I will have to deduct it from your deposit as well. I've been extremely patient with you so I'd expect the same in return.

Nick
